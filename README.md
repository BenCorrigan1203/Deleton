- ingestion_sql.py : This file holds type definitions with the SQL commands, to reduce the cluttering of the code.
- requirements.txt : This file contains a list of the required Python packages to run the scripts in this folder.

### Terraform

- compress_sql.py : This file contains all the SQL commands for the compress_data.py, to allow easier code consumption.
- requirements.txt : This file contains a list of the required Python packages to run the scripts in this folder.

### Report_generation

### This folder contains the files which create the documentation for the C-suite, attached to an email.

- report.py : This file uses the daily schema and extracts several graphs and information from the last 24 hours to form a PDF, which is then sent in an email.
- report_utils.py : This file contains "helper" functions for the report.py to help make the report.py easier to consume.
- deleton.png : This is a image of the Deleton logo used in the PDF.
- requirements.txt : This file contains a list of the required Python packages to run the scripts in this folder.

### Live_dashboard

### This folder contains the files which create the dashboard using flask, for the riders.

- dash_utils.py : This file contains the python scripts to contact the database and form the figures needed in the dashboard.
- sql_vars.py : This file contains the SQL commands used in the dash_utils.py to allow that file to be easier to consume.
- app.py : this file contains the dash template used by each page, which holds the navigation bar and references to the pages.
- pages
  - current_ride.py : This file contains the plotly graphs of the current heart rate, resistance and power graphs.
  - recent_rides.py : This file contains the plotly graphs of the recent rides and shows the gender split and age groups.

### Database_reset

### This folder contains the files which create the dashboard using flask, for the riders.

- database_reset.py : This file drops all the tables and then creates the tables in both schemas.
- reset.sql : This file has all the SQL commands needed to drop and create
